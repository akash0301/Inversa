A vulnerability is a weakness in a website or web application that can be exploited by a hacker
to gain unauthorised access, steal sensitive information, or perform other malicious actions.
Vulnerabilities can be caused by a variety of factors, including poorly-written code, inadequate
security measures, and outdated software. It is important for website and web application
owners to regularly check for vulnerabilities and take steps to fix them to protect their users and
their own security.The person responsible for doing that is Penetration Tester and this process
involves a number of steps. But some of the steps at the start do not require any manual
work and can be automated since it only involves running certain commands and gathering
information that can help them to work on things that can help them detect loopholes.Although
a hacker can use different ways to exploit vulnerabilities there are certain vulnerabilities that
are majorly exploited to get information. As per Open Web Application Security Project
OWASP which is open source non profit organisation that works on improving security of
websites Injection, Port Enumeration and misconfiguration are the categories of vulnerabilities
that comes in Top 10 vulnerabilities found in websites.We have focused on this vulnerabilities
and automated the process of information gathering required for detecting these vulnerabilities
and also created a parser to parse through the output of the tools that are executed and then
map that to the severity of the vulnerability and provide proper remediation.
